# skype-android-app-sdk-samples Guest Meeting Join sample

This sample uses the core **Skype for Business App SDK** API to
join meetings, chat, and share video. It prompts you for a join meeting URL at runtime. The sample has local references to the SDK libraries that you download to 
your development computer. 

Before you can run the Android samples in the [skype-android-app-sdk-samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-android-app-sdk-samples) repository, 
you need to have two things:

1. The **Skype for Business App SDK** libraries which you can download from [Skype for Business App SDK download](http://aka.ms/sfbappsdkdownload_android). 
2. The join meeting URL for an established **Skype for Business** meeting.



## Copy the Skype for Business App SDK libraries into the project

The samples already include local references to the **Skype for Business** libraries. After you clone the repository, you need to copy the libraries into
the sample project folders at: _[your local repository]\HealthcareApp\app\libs_. 


## Run the sample

The **Skype for Business App SDK** does not support Android Studio emulators. You need to run the sample on a armeabi-v7a mobile device. See [Platform Considerations](PlatformConsiderations.md) for 
more information.

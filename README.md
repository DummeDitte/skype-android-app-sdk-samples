# skype-android-app-sdk-samples

Before you can run the Android samples in the [skype-android-app-sdk-samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-android-app-sdk-samples) repository, 
you need to have two things:

1. The **Skype for Business App SDK** libraries which you can download from [Skype for Business App SDK download](http://aka.ms/sfbappsdkdownload_android).  
2. The join meeting URL for an established **Skype for Business** meeting.


## Healthcare App Sample
The [Healthcare Apps ample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-android-app-sdk-samples/tree/master/HealthcareApp) uses the ConversationHelper class from the SDK helpers classes to make anonymously joining a Skype for Business meeting a simple task. The sample declares a class that implements a helper callback and makes just a few calls into the helper to join a meeting and share video.   

## GuestMeetingJoin sample
the [Guest Meeting Join sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-android-app-sdk-samples/tree/master/GuestMeetingJoin) uses the core **Skype for Business App SDK** API to
join meetings, chat, and share video. It prompts you for a join meeting URL at runtime. The sample has local references to the SDK libraries that you download to 
your development computer.
